## Introduction
This is the official implementation for the paper, **"C3P: Cross-domain Pose Prior Propagation for Weakly Supervised 3D Human Pose Estimation"**, ECCV 2022. 


## C3P_code
***
 CMU is in CMUP_open.   
 ITOP is in ITOP_open.   
 
 ##Installation
 Install the corresponding dependencies in the requirement.txt
 mkdir 'model;output;data' in both CMU_open and ITOP_open
